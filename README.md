# RecifacilProject
Context
Basically, when entering the site, the user is asked to register, after being registered, the user can log into his account and make a collection request, informing which material or materials he wants to recycle. This request will appear for the nearest collection point, so he will have access to the amount of material, type of material and its exact location.
With this, it is enough to send a collector or, if applicable, a recycling truck. The user will also be able to edit his profile information or delete his account from our Database if he so wishes.
When developing this project, I thought of the user who wants to make just one donation and also of the company that wants to better manage its collection system.
